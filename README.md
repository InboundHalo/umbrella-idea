# 🌧️ Umbrella Share Service — Stay Dry, Stay Mobile

Welcome to **Umbrella Share Service**, a smart and sustainable solution for rainy-day mobility in the city!

We know sudden weather changes can disrupt your plans. Buying a new umbrella every storm is wasteful, and carrying one around all day is inconvenient. That’s why we created a **network of shared umbrellas**, available anytime — right when you need them.
