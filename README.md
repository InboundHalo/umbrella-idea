# Umbrella Share
Welcome to Umbrella Share, a hackathon project by university of Waterloo students.

Umbrella Share lets people borrow umbrellas with their WATCard (A University of Waterloo student ID).
## What We Offer
- Stations with umbrellas that can be borrowed
- Borrow and return anywhere
- Free for University of Waterloo Students
## How It Works
### User Experience
1. Go up to one of the stations
2. Tap your WATCard to the NFC reader
3. Grab your umbrella and go
4. At a later time, return the umbrella at any docking station when done
### Backend
WATCards have a unique value stored on them. 
The backend takes in this unique value with a unique value that would be specific to each umbrella.
It will allow someone to take a umbrella out if they do not have a umbrella checked out already.
Anyone can return any umbrella.
